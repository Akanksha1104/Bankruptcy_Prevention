🏦 Bankruptcy Prevention Using Machine Learning
This project predicts whether a company is at risk of bankruptcy using supervised machine learning algorithms. By analyzing financial data, it helps identify potential red flags early, aiding in strategic planning and risk mitigation.

 📊 Problem Statement
Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for investors, creditors, and business managers. Using historical financial data of companies, the goal is to build a classification model that can predict whether a firm is likely to go bankrupt.

 ✅ Objectives
- Classify companies as **bankrupt** or **non-bankrupt**
- Evaluate multiple ML models for best accuracy
- Analyze feature importance for financial indicators

 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
